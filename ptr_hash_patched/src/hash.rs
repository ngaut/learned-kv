//! Implementations of various hashers to use with PtrHash.
//!
//! ## Integer keys
//!
//! We provide:
//! - [`NoHash`]: does nothing -- only use on truly random keys.
//! - [`FastIntHash`] = [`FxHash`], which does a single wrapping multiplication and should be good enough most of the time.
//! - [`StrongerIntHash`]: Use this when the input keys are very regular, eg `0..1000`. (But then why do you need an MPHF anyway?)
//!                Does a `u128` multiplication, and xors the high and low word together, like xxh3. Then does one more multiplication. Not very scientific but 'it works'.
//! - [`GxInt`]: GxHash, but with the type 'inlined' so that it optimized better.
//! - [`Xxh3Int`]: Xxh3, but with the type 'inlined' so that it optimized better.
//!
//! In practice, prefer [`FastIntHash`] if it's good enough.
//! Otherwise, fall back to [`StrongerIntHash`].
//! If that still fails (which probably shouldn't happen) fall back to one of the two remaining
//!
//! If [`StrongerIntHash`] lacks sufficient randomness, use [`Xxh3Int`] instead, which is considerably slower but much stronger.
//!
//! ## String keys
//!
//! For string keys, use [`StringHash`] for 64-bit hashes and [`StringHash128`] for 128-bit hashes.
//! These are aliases for 64bit and 128bit versions of gxhash, respectively.
//!
//! Another option is to use [`FxHash`] instead.
//!
//! In general any type implementing `Hasher` can be used, but it may be more
//! efficient to implement [`KeyHasher`] yourself for your key type, to directly
//! call specialized functions rather than going through the generic `Hasher`
//! interface.
//!
